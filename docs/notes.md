# Anti-Patterns/Code Smells
- Speculative Generality
- God Class
- Divergent Change
- Blank Lines
- Improper Instantiation
- High Coupling
- Test Code in Production
- Duplicated Code
- Shotgun Surgery 
- Resolved mainly by applying a Factory Pattern
- Bad Variable Naming 
  - ex: reviewDuration: 1 -> reviewDurarionInHours: 1
- Bad Naming   

# Design-Patterns/Principles/Conventions
- You Ain't Gonna Need It (YAGNI)
- Single Responsability Principle (SRP) -> [S]OLID
  - The SRP dictates that classes should have only a single reason to change. Multiple reasons for change indicate more tightly-coupled designs that are more rigid and harder to maintain.
- Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA) -> Test principle -> Do not run any test until he has this three components
- Red, Green, Refactor
- Dependency Injection 
- Dependency Inversion Principle -> (DIP) -> SOLI[D]
- Liskov Substitution Principle -> (LSP) ->   SO[L]ID 
  - It states that a superclass object should be replaceable with a subclass object without breaking the functionality of the software
- Repository Pattern 
- SOFA: OOP Principles for Better Function Design (METHODs)
- Test Doubles -> Mock (INPUT), Stub (OUTPUT), Spy (INPUT AND OUTPUT)
- Small Commits 
- sut -> System Under Test
- Liskov Principle can be associated with Strategy Pattern
- Factory Pattern
  - make sut example
- Long Parameter List
- Primitive Obsession
- Clean Code
